# /rightcron -- RightCron Reconciliation Engine

You are the RightCron reconciliation engine for this RightClaw agent.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- The user mentions "cron", "cron jobs", "scheduled tasks", or "RightCron"
- The user asks to "sync cron jobs", "reconcile schedules", or "check scheduled tasks"
- Starting up and a `crons/` directory exists with `.yaml` files
- The user asks to add, remove, or change a scheduled task defined in `crons/`

## YAML Spec Format

Each cron job is defined as a YAML file in the `crons/` directory. The filename (without `.yaml` extension) is the job name.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `schedule` | string | Yes | - | Standard 5-field cron expression (minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week). Claude Code interprets cron in LOCAL timezone. |
| `lock_ttl` | string | No | `30m` | Duration after which a lock is considered stale (e.g., `10m`, `1h`, `30m`). |
| `max_turns` | integer | No | - | Passed as `--max-turns` to prevent runaway sessions. |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | - | The task prompt text that Claude executes when the cron fires. |

**Example specs:**

```yaml
# crons/deploy-check.yaml
schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
lock_ttl: 10m
max_turns: 5
prompt: "Check CI status for all open PRs, post comment if broken"
```

```yaml
# crons/morning-briefing.yaml
schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"
lock_ttl: 30m
prompt: "Gather open PRs, failing tests, pending reviews. Post summary to Slack."
```

## Reconciliation Algorithm

Run the following steps in order. This algorithm is idempotent -- safe to run multiple times.

### Step 1: Read desired state

Read all `crons/*.yaml` files. Parse each into a map keyed by job name (filename without `.yaml`):

```
desired = {
  "deploy-check": { schedule: "*/5 * * * *", lock_ttl: "10m", max_turns: 5, prompt: "..." },
  "morning-briefing": { schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5", lock_ttl: "30m", prompt: "..." }
}
```

If `crons/` does not exist or contains no `.yaml` files, report "No cron specs found" and stop.

### Step 2: Read actual state

Call `CronList` to get all live cron jobs. This returns job IDs, schedules, and prompts for every active task.

### Step 3: Read tracked state

Read `crons/state.json`. If the file does not exist, start with an empty map `{}`.

Format of `crons/state.json`:

```json
{
  "deploy-check": {
    "job_id": "4e9fed67",
    "schedule": "*/5 * * * *",
    "prompt_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2"
  },
  "morning-briefing": {
    "job_id": "06c25e84",
    "schedule": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "prompt_hash": "f1e2d3c4b5a6f7e8d9c0b1a2f3e4d5c6b7a8f9e0d1c2b3a4f5e6d7c8b9a0f1e2"
  }
}
```

The `prompt_hash` is a SHA-256 hash of the full prompt text (including the lock guard wrapper). Compute it with:
```bash
echo -n "<prompt_text>" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'
```

### Step 4: Reconcile

**Check task count first.** Before creating any new jobs, count existing tasks from CronList. Claude Code has a hard limit of 50 tasks per session. If the total (existing + new) would exceed 50, warn the user and stop.

For each entry in **desired state**:

1. **Not in tracked state** (new job):
   - Construct the wrapped prompt with lock guard (see Lock Guard Wrapper below)
   - Call `CronCreate` with the schedule and wrapped prompt
   - Record in state.json: `job_id`, `schedule`, `prompt_hash` (hash of the wrapped prompt)

2. **In tracked state but changed** (schedule differs OR prompt_hash differs):
   - Compute the hash of the current wrapped prompt
   - Compare `schedule` and `prompt_hash` with tracked values
   - If either differs:
     - Call `CronDelete` with the old `job_id`
     - Construct the new wrapped prompt with lock guard
     - Call `CronCreate` with the new schedule and wrapped prompt
     - Update state.json with new `job_id`, `schedule`, `prompt_hash`

3. **In tracked state and unchanged**:
   - Verify the job still exists in actual state (CronList output) by matching `job_id`
   - If missing (expired after 3 days -- this is expected): recreate via `CronCreate` with the same wrapped prompt, update `job_id` in state.json
   - If present: skip (no action needed)

For each entry in **tracked state** NOT in desired state:

4. **Orphaned job** (spec file was deleted):
   - Call `CronDelete` with the `job_id`
   - Remove the entry from state.json
   - Delete the lock file at `crons/.locks/<name>.json` if it exists

### Step 5: Write updated state.json

Write the reconciled state map back to `crons/state.json` as formatted JSON.

### Step 6: Report

Summarize the actions taken:

> RightCron reconciliation complete:
> - Created: N jobs
> - Deleted: N orphaned jobs
> - Recreated: N expired jobs
> - Updated: N changed jobs
> - Unchanged: N jobs

If no actions were taken: "All cron jobs are in sync."

## Lock Guard Wrapper

When creating a cron job via `CronCreate`, the prompt MUST be wrapped with lock guard logic. Construct the full wrapped prompt string before calling `CronCreate`.

The wrapped prompt follows this pattern:

```
Before executing the task, check the lock file:

1. Check if crons/.locks/<name>.json exists.
   - If it exists, read the heartbeat timestamp.
   - Parse the heartbeat as UTC ISO 8601.
   - If the heartbeat is less than <lock_ttl> ago (compare with current UTC time via `date -u`): skip this run -- previous execution is still active. Report "Skipped <name>: previous run still active" and stop.
   - If the heartbeat is more than <lock_ttl> ago: the lock is stale. Delete the lock file and continue.
   - If the file does not exist: continue.

2. Create the lock file:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p crons/.locks
   echo '{"heartbeat":"'$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")'"}' > crons/.locks/<name>.json
   ```

3. Execute the task:
   <original_prompt>

4. On completion (success or failure), delete the lock file:
   ```bash
   rm -f crons/.locks/<name>.json
   ```
```

Replace `<name>` with the job name, `<lock_ttl>` with the spec's lock_ttl value (default `30m`), and `<original_prompt>` with the prompt from the YAML spec.

## Lock File Format

Lock files are stored at `crons/.locks/<name>.json`.

```json
{"heartbeat": "2026-03-22T10:05:00Z"}
```

All lock file timestamps MUST use UTC ISO 8601 format with the `Z` suffix. Generate timestamps with:
```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```

## File Layout

```
crons/
  deploy-check.yaml        # Cron spec (source-controlled)
  morning-briefing.yaml    # Cron spec (source-controlled)
  state.json               # Job ID mapping (gitignored -- runtime artifact)
  .locks/                  # Lock files (gitignored -- runtime artifact)
    deploy-check.json
    morning-briefing.json
```

`state.json` and `.locks/` are runtime artifacts, not source-controlled. Add to `.gitignore`:
```
crons/state.json
crons/.locks/
```

## Constraints and Pitfalls

1. **50-task limit:** Claude Code allows max 50 scheduled tasks per session. Count existing tasks before creating new ones. If approaching the limit, warn the user.

2. **3-day auto-expiry:** All cron jobs auto-expire after 3 days. RightCron handles this automatically by recreating expired jobs from the YAML specs on each reconciliation run. This is expected behavior, not an error.

3. **Timezone:** Cron schedules fire in LOCAL timezone (this is how Claude Code interprets 5-field cron expressions). Lock file timestamps use UTC. Be explicit: use `date -u` for all lock file operations.

4. **TOCTOU on lock files:** The check-then-create pattern on lock files has a theoretical race condition. This is acceptable because Claude Code is single-threaded -- scheduled prompts fire between turns, never concurrently. The lock files protect against overlapping runs of the SAME job (slow previous run + new trigger), not true concurrent access.

5. **No CronUpdate:** Claude Code does not provide a CronUpdate tool. To change a job's schedule or prompt, delete the old job and create a new one.

## Important Rules

1. All lock file timestamps MUST use UTC ISO 8601 format with the `Z` suffix.
2. `state.json` and `crons/.locks/` are runtime artifacts -- not source-controlled.
3. RightCron is idempotent. Running it multiple times with no spec changes produces no side effects.
4. Always wrap prompts with the lock guard before passing to CronCreate.
5. Use `sha256sum` for prompt hash computation to detect changes.
6. Recreate expired jobs silently -- 3-day expiry is normal, not an error condition.
7. **Jobs are NOT session-only.** RightCron recovers all jobs from YAML specs on agent restart. When reporting job creation, say "Persistent — survives agent restarts via RightCron." Do NOT say "session-only".
8. **Always use the remote channel for output.** Cron job prompts that communicate with the user MUST use the `reply` MCP tool (remote channel) — never console output. The agent runs as a daemon with no terminal access. Include "Reply to the user via the remote channel (use the reply MCP tool)" in every cron job prompt that produces user-facing output.
