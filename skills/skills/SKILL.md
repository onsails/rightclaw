# /skills -- Agent Skills Manager (skills.sh)

You are the skill manager for this RightClaw agent, powered by [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) (Vercel's Agent Skills directory).

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user:
- Wants to install a skill (e.g., "install a skill", "add skill", "get me a skill for...")
- Wants to find or search for skills (e.g., "find skills", "search skills", "what skills are available")
- Mentions skills.sh, skill packages, or skill management
- Wants to remove or uninstall a skill (e.g., "remove skill", "uninstall skill")
- Wants to list installed skills (e.g., "list installed skills", "what skills do I have")
- Wants to update skills (e.g., "update skills", "upgrade skill")

## Configuration

**Directory:** [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) -- Vercel's open Agent Skills directory

**CLI:** `npx skills` -- the official CLI for managing skills

**Skill install path:** `.claude/skills/<name>/` (standard Agent Skills path, relative to agent cwd)

**Registry file:** `.claude/skills/installed.json` (tracks all installed skills for this agent)

## Commands

### search \<query\>

Search the skills.sh directory for skills matching a query.

1. Run the search command:
   ```bash
   npx skills find "<query>"
   ```

2. If `npx skills find` is not available or fails, fall back to GitHub topic search:
   ```bash
   gh search repos "<query>" --topic=agent-skill --json fullName,description,stargazersCount --limit 20
   ```

3. Present results as a formatted table:

   | Name | Description | Stars |
   |------|-------------|-------|
   | vercel-labs/agent-skills | Official Vercel skills collection | 1200 |

4. Ask the user if they want to install any of the results.

**Error handling:**
- If `npx` is not available: inform the user to install Node.js. Suggest manual git clone as a fallback: `git clone <repo-url> .claude/skills/<name>/`
- If the search returns no results: suggest broadening the query or browsing https://skills.sh directly.

### install \<slug\>

Install a skill by its slug (e.g., `vercel-labs/agent-skills`). The slug is in `owner/repo` format (GitHub shorthand).

**Step 1: Preview available skills**

```bash
npx skills add <slug> --list
```

This lists all skills in the repository without installing. Let the user pick which ones to install if the repo contains multiple skills.

**Step 2: Install the skill**

```bash
npx skills add <slug> -a claude --copy -y
```

Flags:
- `-a claude` -- target Claude Code agent
- `--copy` -- copy files instead of symlinking (ensures portability)
- `-y` -- skip confirmation prompts

If `npx` is unavailable, fall back to manual installation:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 "https://github.com/<slug>.git" /tmp/skills-install
# Copy SKILL.md (and any accompanying files) to .claude/skills/<name>/
mkdir -p .claude/skills/<name>
cp -r /tmp/skills-install/skills/<name>/* .claude/skills/<name>/ 2>/dev/null || cp -r /tmp/skills-install/* .claude/skills/<name>/
rm -rf /tmp/skills-install
```

**Pre-install domain check**

Before running `npx skills add`, verify that the install command itself can reach its required domains.

Read `.claude/settings.json` and check `sandbox.network.allowedDomains`:

```bash
cat .claude/settings.json
```

- If `skills.sh` is absent from `allowedDomains`: warn and stop.
  > Warning: `skills.sh` is not in your sandbox `allowedDomains`. Add it to your `agent.yaml` sandbox overrides: `allowed_domains: [skills.sh, registry.npmjs.org]`
  > After updating `agent.yaml`, run `rightclaw up` to regenerate `settings.json`, then retry.
- If `registry.npmjs.org` (or `npmjs.org`) is absent: add the same warning.
- If both are present: proceed with `npx skills add`.

**Step 3: Policy gate audit**

After the skill files are downloaded to `.claude/skills/<name>/`, read the skill's SKILL.md and check its `compatibility` field:

```bash
head -20 .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

**If the skill has no `compatibility` field:** treat as no requirements — proceed directly to Step 4.

**If a `compatibility` field is present:** interpret it as natural language to identify requirement categories:

- **Bins:** binary names (e.g., `git`, `docker`, `python3`, `node`, `jq`) — any named executable tool
- **Env vars:** ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES tokens that are not domain names (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- **Network:** domain-like tokens containing dots (e.g., `api.openai.com`, `registry.npmjs.org`)
- **Filesystem write:** any phrase like "read-write access", "writes to", "modifies files outside", "filesystem write"

Run the following checks:

```bash
# Read the agent's sandbox configuration
cat .claude/settings.json

# Check each required binary
which <bin>

# Check each required env var
printenv <VAR>
```

Apply the two-tier gate:

**BLOCK (sandbox-enforced — do not proceed):**
- A required network domain is NOT present in `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` in `.claude/settings.json`
- A required filesystem write path is NOT covered by `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` in `.claude/settings.json`

**WARN only (advisory — proceed after informing the user):**
- A required binary is not found in PATH (`which` returns nothing)
- A required env var is not set (`printenv` returns nothing)

Display the full audit result as a table before deciding to proceed or block:

| Permission | Required | Status |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Binary: git | Yes | OK |
| Env: OPENAI_API_KEY | Yes | WARN — not set |
| Network: api.openai.com | Yes | BLOCK — not in allowedDomains |
| Filesystem: read-write | Yes | OK |

**If any BLOCK condition is present:**
> Installation blocked. The skill requires network or filesystem access that your agent's sandbox does not allow. Add the missing domains or write paths to your `agent.yaml` sandbox section, then run `rightclaw up` to regenerate `settings.json`, and retry the installation.

Do NOT auto-expand the agent's sandbox config. The user must explicitly update `agent.yaml`.

**If no BLOCK conditions (WARNs only or all pass):** inform the user of any warnings, then proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Register in installed.json**

Read `.claude/skills/installed.json`. If it does not exist, create it with `{}`.

Add an entry for the new skill:

```json
{
  "<name>": {
    "slug": "vercel-labs/agent-skills",
    "installed_at": "2026-03-22T10:00:00Z",
    "path": ".claude/skills/<name>",
    "source": "skills.sh"
  }
}
```

All timestamps MUST use UTC ISO 8601 format with the `Z` suffix. Generate the timestamp with:
```bash
date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
```

Write the updated JSON back to `.claude/skills/installed.json`.

**Step 5: Confirm installation**

Report to the user:
> Installed **<name>** from skills.sh (`<slug>`). The skill is now available at `.claude/skills/<name>/`.

### remove \<name\>

Remove an installed skill by name.

1. First try the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx skills remove <name> -a claude -y
   ```

2. If the CLI is unavailable, remove manually:
   - Read `.claude/skills/installed.json`. If it does not exist, inform the user that no skills are tracked.
   - Check if `<name>` exists in the registry.
     - If not found: inform the user that the skill is not installed (or not tracked). Check if `.claude/skills/<name>/` exists on disk -- if so, suggest it may have been manually installed.
   - If found:
     - Delete the `.claude/skills/<name>/` directory: `rm -rf .claude/skills/<name>/`
     - Remove the entry from `.claude/skills/installed.json`
     - Write the updated JSON back to `.claude/skills/installed.json`

3. Confirm removal:
   > Removed **<name>** and unregistered it from installed.json.

### list

List all installed skills for this agent.

1. First try the CLI:
   ```bash
   npx skills list -a claude
   ```

2. Additionally, read `.claude/skills/installed.json`. If it does not exist, start with an empty registry.

3. Scan the `.claude/skills/` directory for subdirectories containing a `SKILL.md` file. Include any skills found on disk but not in `installed.json` (these are manually installed or installed via `npx skills add`).

4. Present a table:

   | Name | Source | Installed |
   |------|--------|-----------|
   | agent-browser | skills.sh | 2026-03-22T10:00:00Z |
   | my-custom-skill | manual | - |

   - Source is `skills.sh` if tracked in `installed.json`, `manual` if found on disk only.
   - Installed date comes from `installed.json`; show `-` for manually installed skills.

### update

Update installed skills to their latest versions.

```bash
npx skills update -a claude
```

If `npx` is unavailable, suggest the user re-install the skill: `npx skills add <slug> -a claude --copy -y`

### skill-doctor

Audit all installed skills against this agent's current sandbox configuration. Reports whether each skill's requirements are satisfied.

**Step 1: Discover installed skills**

Union two sources to build the complete skill list:

```bash
# Source 1: tracked skills
cat .claude/skills/installed.json

# Source 2: scan disk for any SKILL.md not in installed.json
ls .claude/skills/
```

Skills found on disk but absent from `installed.json` are labeled `manual` (matching the `list` command convention).

**Step 2: Read sandbox configuration**

```bash
cat .claude/settings.json
```

Extract `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` and `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` from the output.

**Step 3: Check each skill**

For each skill (from both sources):

```bash
# Read the skill's compatibility field
head -20 .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
```

If the skill has no `compatibility` field: mark all checks as `—` (no requirements) and status as `PASS`.

If a `compatibility` field is present: interpret it to identify bins, env vars, network domains, and filesystem requirements (same logic as the install gate in Step 3 of `install`).

```bash
# Check each required binary
which <bin>

# Check each required env var
printenv <VAR>
```

Compare required network domains against `allowedDomains` and required filesystem write paths against `allowWrite`.

**Step 4: Report results**

Present a single table covering all skills:

| Skill | Source | Bins | Env Vars | Network | Status |
|-------|--------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| rightcron | skills.sh | — | — | — | PASS |
| my-skill | skills.sh | git ✓ | API_KEY ✗ | api.example.com ✗ | WARN |
| custom-tool | manual | docker ✓ | — | api.custom.com ✗ | BLOCK |

Status rules:
- **PASS**: all checks pass (or no requirements)
- **WARN**: one or more required binaries missing from PATH or env vars unset — but no sandbox violations
- **BLOCK**: one or more required network domains absent from `allowedDomains`, or required write path absent from `allowWrite`

After the table, summarize any actionable items:
- For each BLOCK: name the missing domain or write path and remind the user to update `agent.yaml` sandbox overrides and run `rightclaw up`.
- For each WARN: name the missing binary or env var and suggest installing/setting it.

## Error Handling

- **npx not available:** Inform the user to install Node.js (v18+). Suggest manual git clone as fallback.
- **Network errors:** If the GitHub API or npx commands fail, inform the user and suggest manual git clone: `git clone <repo-url> .claude/skills/<name>/`
- **Missing installed.json:** Create an empty `{}` file automatically -- this is normal for a fresh agent.
- **Skills not found:** Suggest browsing https://skills.sh or searching GitHub directly with `gh search repos`.

## Important Rules

1. All timestamps MUST use UTC ISO 8601 format with the `Z` suffix (e.g., `2026-03-22T10:00:00Z`).
2. Never install a skill without running the pre-install domain check (Step 2) and the policy gate audit (Step 3) first. No exceptions.
3. Never auto-expand the agent's sandbox config to accommodate a skill's requirements. The user must explicitly update `agent.yaml` sandbox overrides.
4. Each agent has its own `.claude/skills/` directory and `installed.json` -- no shared or global skill location.
5. Skills installed manually (via git clone or `npx skills add`) appear in `list` output but are tracked differently.
6. The `--copy` flag is mandatory for `npx skills add` to ensure files are portable and not symlinked.
