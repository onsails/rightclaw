# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06 after v3.3 milestone)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by native OS-level isolation, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** Phase 43 — init-detection-up-revalidation

## Current Position

Phase: 43 (init-detection-up-revalidation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 2
Phase: 43 (next) — not yet started
Status: Executing Phase 43
Last activity: 2026-04-06 -- Phase 43 execution started

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

*Carried from v3.3 for reference — see full table in previous STATE.md*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions relevant to v3.4:

- [v3.4 research]: Never use `npx` in .mcp.json — absolute path to globally-installed binary only
- [v3.4 research]: Chrome sandbox: `--no-sandbox` arg (bubblewrap is outer sandbox) + allowedCommands + allowWrite for userDataDir
- [v3.4 research]: Chrome path revalidated on every `rightclaw up`, not just init
- [v3.4 research]: All Chrome features are non-fatal — Warn severity throughout, never abort
- [phase 42]: ChromeConfig follows TunnelConfig pattern exactly — two PathBuf fields, no chrome_profile field (hardcoded .chrome-profile in codegen)
- [phase 42]: global_cfg read hoisted before per-agent loop in cmd_up() — single read shared by chrome_cfg and tunnel block
- [phase 42]: allowed_commands emitted only when non-empty — cleaner JSON, matching excludedCommands pattern

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None for phase 43. Phase 42 verification resolved the chrome binary install path question — mcp_binary_path is a user-configured field in config.yaml, no convention assumption needed at this layer.
