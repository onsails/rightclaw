# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by OpenShell policies, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-and-agent-discovery

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse granularity -- 4 phases compressing 7 research-suggested phases
- [Roadmap]: SAND-04/SAND-05 in Phase 1 (policy schema) rather than Phase 2 (runtime) -- types before logic
- [Roadmap]: Telegram channel support (CHAN-*) grouped with default agent (Phase 3) since CHAN-02 ties to BOOTSTRAP.md
- [Phase 01]: Added clap env feature for RIGHTCLAW_HOME env var support
- [Phase 01]: resolve_home takes env_home as parameter (not std::env), per CLAUDE.rust.md
- [Phase 01]: AgentConfig uses deny_unknown_fields for strict YAML validation
- [Phase 01]: Tests extracted to separate _tests.rs files using #[path] attribute for separation of concerns
- [Phase 01]: Embedded templates via include_str! from templates/ directory at repo root

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenShell is alpha (3 days old) -- may have breaking changes during implementation. Abstract behind trait.
- OAuth token race condition with multiple concurrent Claude Code sessions -- default to API keys.
