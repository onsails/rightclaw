# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06 after v3.3 milestone)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by native OS-level isolation, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Chrome Config Infrastructure + MCP Injection

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Chrome Config Infrastructure + MCP Injection)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-06 — v3.4 roadmap created, Phase 2 ready to plan

## Performance Metrics

*Carried from v3.3 for reference — see full table in previous STATE.md*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions relevant to v3.4:

- [v3.4 research]: Never use `npx` in .mcp.json — absolute path to globally-installed binary only
- [v3.4 research]: Chrome sandbox: `--no-sandbox` arg (bubblewrap is outer sandbox) + allowedCommands + allowWrite for userDataDir
- [v3.4 research]: Chrome path revalidated on every `rightclaw up`, not just init
- [v3.4 research]: All Chrome features are non-fatal — Warn severity throughout, never abort

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need to verify `chrome-devtools-mcp` binary install path convention (global npm vs. cargo) before Phase 2 implementation
