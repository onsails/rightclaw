# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-24)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by native OS-level isolation, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** Phase 8: HOME Isolation & Permission Model

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 10 (HOME Isolation & Permission Model)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-24 -- Roadmap created for v2.1 milestone

Progress: [..........] 0% (v2.1 milestone)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6 (v2.0)
- Average duration: ~3 min
- Total execution time: ~20 min

**By Phase (v2.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 05 | 2 | 11min | 5.5min |
| Phase 06 | 2 | 6min | 3min |
| Phase 07 | 2 | 3min | 1.5min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 6 plans: 9min, 2min, 4min, 2min, 2min, 1min
- Trend: Improving

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.1]: HOME override as primary isolation (not CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR alone) -- .claude.json race condition is the forcing function
- [v2.1]: Keep --dangerously-skip-permissions but suppress bypass warning via pre-populated .claude.json
- [v2.1]: Symlink credentials (not copy) -- keeps tokens fresh
- [v2.1]: Managed settings opt-in only -- machine-wide side effect needs sudo + explicit user consent
- [v2.1]: Pre-populate ALL .claude/ files at `rightclaw up` time -- avoids protected directory write prompts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Protected directory write prompt (CC #35718) may block headless if pre-population misses a path
- OAuth broken under HOME override on Linux -- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required for headless
- CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR + HOME interaction precedence needs empirical validation during Phase 8
