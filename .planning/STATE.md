# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-03 after v3.1 milestone)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by native OS-level isolation, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** Phase 36 — COMPLETE

## Current Position

Phase: 36 (auto-derive-cfargotunnel-hostname-from-tunnel-token-jwt) — COMPLETE
Plan: 1 of 1
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-04 -- Phase 37 planning complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 36 added: Auto-derive cfargotunnel hostname from tunnel token JWT
- Phase 37 added: Fix v3.2 UAT gaps: tunnel setup flow (--tunnel-hostname, DNS routing wrapper, doctor checks), MCP tracing logs, mcp status labels, rightclaw up warning visibility

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions relevant to v3.2:

- [v3.2 research]: Wrong credential key is invisible at runtime — unit test against live Notion entry (`notion|eac663db915250e7`) is mandatory before integration work
- [v3.2 research]: CC token refresh broken in headless mode (issues #28262, #29718) — rightclaw owns all refresh logic
- [v3.2 research]: `mcp-needs-auth-cache.json` is per-agent (under agent HOME), not host — detect.rs reads .mcp.json + .credentials.json directly
- [v3.2 research]: Tunnel is mandatory for Telegram-initiated OAuth (users cannot access localhost URLs); CLI-initiated flow can print URL to terminal
- [v3.2 research]: cloudflared quick tunnel (no account required) chosen over ngrok (authtoken required for stable URLs)
- [v3.2 research]: axum 0.8 + oauth2 5.0 + open 5.3 + sha2 0.10 added as new workspace deps
- [v3.2 research]: expiresAt=0 means non-expiring (Linear); must skip in refresh loop
- [v3.2 research]: Agent must be restarted after OAuth — CC MCP client does not reconnect in-process (issue #10250)
- [Phase 32-credential-foundation]: serde_json::json! sorts keys alphabetically — build compact JSON manually to guarantee type->url->headers field order for CC credential key formula
- [Phase 32-credential-foundation]: Backup rotation slot shift must iterate ascending to avoid overwriting slots; concurrent ENOENT on rename is benign (TOCTOU)
- [Phase 33-auth-detection]: expires_at=0 treated as Present (non-expiring), not Expired — Linear case
- [Phase 33-auth-detection]: Stdio servers (no url field) silently skipped — url presence is the OAuth candidate boundary
- [Phase 34]: rand 0.10 uses RngExt trait for fill() on ThreadRng (not Rng or RngCore)
- [Phase 34]: GlobalConfig YAML write is manual (serde-saphyr deserialize-only); schema is 2 fields so manual formatting is sufficient
- [Phase 34-core-oauth-flow]: reqwest form feature added to workspace — exchange_token requires application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST
- [Phase 34-core-oauth-flow]: discovery_urls helper extracts URL construction for pure unit tests without HTTP
- [Phase 34]: cloudflared process in PC config is conditional on tunnel_token — bots without tunnel work unchanged
- [Phase 34]: catch-all http_status:404 is always emitted regardless of agent count — cloudflared rejects configs without it
- [Phase 34]: write_credential takes (path, server_name, server_url, token) and derives key internally; plan interface mismatch auto-corrected
- [Phase 34]: exchange_token arg order: (client, endpoint, code, redirect_uri, client_id, secret, verifier) — not as documented in plan
- [Phase 35]: client_id stored as Some(String) always — PendingAuth.client_id is non-optional (DCR or static fallback guarantees it); client_secret is Option to handle public/confidential clients
- [Phase 35]: deadline_from_unix returns None for expires_at=0 (REFRESH-04), underflow guard, and within-buffer — all mean refresh immediately or never
- [Phase 35]: refresh_token fallback: keep old token if provider doesn't return new one — handles both rotating and non-rotating providers
- [Phase 35]: check_mcp_tokens uses _with_creds inner function for testability — tests inject credentials path; wrapper resolves host path

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `discoveryState` internal field schema not fully documented — inspect live .credentials.json during Phase 34 planning
- process-compose single-agent restart endpoint — verify exact endpoint/payload during Phase 34 planning (pattern exists in codebase)
- macOS: MCP tokens may use Keychain (CC issue #19456) — v3.2 scoped to Linux only
