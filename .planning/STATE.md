# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** Run multiple autonomous Claude Code agents safely -- each sandboxed by native OS-level isolation, orchestrated by a single CLI command.
**Current focus:** v2.2 Phase 11 — Env Var Injection

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 13 (Env Var Injection)
Plan: — (not started)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-25 — v2.2 roadmap created, 3 phases derived from 12 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 5 (v2.1)
- Average duration: ~6 min
- Total execution time: ~27 min

**By Phase (v2.1):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 08 | 2 | 30min | 15min |
| Phase 09 | 2 | 9min | 4.5min |
| Phase 10 | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 15min, 15min, 5min, 4min, 3min
- Trend: Improving

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.2]: ClawHub removed completely (not fallback, not opt-in) — skills.sh is the only registry
- [v2.2]: env: values are plaintext only — secretspec/vault deferred to v2.3
- [Phase 10]: write_managed_settings(dir, path) extracted from cmd_config_strict_sandbox for testability
- [Phase 09]: install_builtin_skills extracted from init.rs for reuse in cmd_up
- [Phase 09]: settings.local.json written with {} only when absent — preserves runtime CC and agent writes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OAuth broken under HOME override on Linux -- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required for headless
- `npx` sandbox domain whitelisting deferred -- document approach in SKILL.md instead (Phase 13)
